# #BuildForSDG Cohort-1 JavaScript Assessment

**This is an eligibility assessment for the #BuildforSDG program**
> Yes, the virus only kills a small percentage of those afflicted. Yes, the flu kills 10s of thousands of
people annually. Yes, 80% of people will experience lightweight symptoms with COVID19. Yes the
mortality rate of COVID19 is relatively low (1–2%). All of this true, but is immaterial. They are the
wrong numbers to focus on...
**-- Jason S Warner**

The assessment empowers me to attempt helping society and leaders prepare for the real big problem
of COVID-19, which is its impact on lives, health systems, supply chains, and the economy:

1. Too many patients, not enough hospitals and beds. A serious shortage of ventilators, masks
and other PPE - if we donʼt practice social distancing.
2. Job losses or freezes, low cash flow and low production (even for essentials like food).
These and more from too many people being sick, a sizable number dying (including some
of the best people in many fields), and many others affected by the impact of losing loved
ones or a world operating in slow motion
